# Project/Assignment - Graphics and a Food Truck through JavaFX
This assignment will help you learn about JavaFX, exceptions, and file I/O. You will have to use JavaFX to implement basic GUI elements, such as buttons and textboxes, and keep track of the current state of the food truck. You will have to create one checked exception and one unchecked exception that can be thrown by your program. You also will need to write some results to a file.
